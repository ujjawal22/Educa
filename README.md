# Educa
First version of Eduminati

Educa is a versatile course management system which allows an user(instructor) to create courses with various types of content(text,files,images,videos) so as to make the course more interactive and interesting.
Users(students) can browse through a list of courses and enroll in a course of their choice.
User registration is also integrated in the project to allow new users to register and use the platform.
This is the first version so it's rudimentary but I have added lot of new features in the next version.
